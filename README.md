CSC 4350 Software Engineering Project Implementation of CAPTCHA Authentication

Team Members: Romario Medeiros, Rick Kim, Walter Pompa, Priscilla Martinez

Here is a project I did with these three fine individuals (primarily). After some introductory lessons about Waterfall, Agile, and Scrum, we were tasked with creating a project while implementing Scrum. This github contains the code side of our project. What is not included is the the assignment of sprints, "company" positions we were given for a couple of weeks, and the "client" presentations for our sprints (the client being our professor). We all gave significant contributions towards its completion.
